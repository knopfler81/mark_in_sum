<h2>Lyon Tony Garnier's Hall</h2>
<h3>27th June 2001</h3>

<p>
I've turned 20 last month, life is beautiful and I love Mark Knopfler more and more.
Mark released his 2nd solo album, Sailing to Philadelphia, a wonderful one indeed  Mark! This time I didn't need to whim, my mother likes Mark and wanted to come with me. Great! Isn?t it?</p>
<p>D day arrived; my mother had really bad back pains and was unable to come... I had to sell the ticket or found someone to come with me.
Finally A friend of mine came and we really had a wonderful evening ! Mark was awesome as always! Thank you Mark.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing was the intro of Money for nothing with the Dobro ! It was Sooooo unexpected ! I wasn't yet an " expert" in MK song but I didn't reconised until Mark started singing...
Unfortunaltey I didn't have any camera in 2001, 
<br/>So I'm sorry I can't share any shot...</p>
